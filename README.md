# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to scrape data on Mars from various sources on the web and consolidate it onto one site.

## Process
We began by using a combination of Splinter and BeautifulSoup to automate a web browser and go to various sites, extract the data we wanted, and parse it.  The data was then stored on a MongoDB database to use later.  We extracted the data from the Mongo database and moved it into an HTML file we would use to design the page.  Using Flask, we then created a local server to display everything we had gathered.  Finally, we used Bootstrap to customize the webpage to our liking and hopefully made it more appealing to the end user.
